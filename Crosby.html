        In 2009, when President Barack Obama welcomed the Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins to the White House, 
        he made it a point to congratulate the youngest captain ever to win the Cup, 21-year-old Sidney Crosby.
         Toward the end of the ceremony, Obama got a big laugh when he threw a little shade Crosby's way, remarking, 
         "Sidney must be really fast because there's some big hockey players -- and he's not one of them." 
         A casual fan, Obama did not realize that Crosby had not merely withstood pounding from bigger players
         but gave as good as he got. 
        It's a major part of his game. During Canada's intrasquad scrimmage before the 2005 World Junior Championship,
        Crosby, 5-foot-10 at the time, and the much larger Dion Phaneuf -- 6-foot-3 and 25 pounds heavier -- got into
         a physical confrontation that grew so heated that the coaches had to cancel the rest of that day's practice.
         "He was getting to the net and steamrolling Phaneuf and Phaneuf was almost trying to kill him,"
          said NBC Sports analyst Pierre McGuire, who witnessed the episode in a small North Dakota rink. 
        "We've had our battles over the years," Phaneuf told Chris Johnson of Sportsnet.ca in 2013.
        "I've played against Sid for a long time and I've got the utmost respect for him.
         He's the best player in the League for a reason."

        Fortunately, the president got the chance to make amends. 
        In October 2016, the champion Penguins returned to the White House, and Obama said:
         "Last time he was here, I took a cheap shot at Sid for his size. I wasn't the first one, on or off the ice. 
         Of course since then, he's won two Olympic golds (2010, 2014), a World Championship (2015), a World Cup MVP (2016), 
         a playoff MVP (2016), another NHL MVP (2014), 
        a mountain of other postseason awards. ...
        And, of course, he hoisted this trophy right here, his second Stanley Cup."
        </p>
        <p>That list, Obama said, was "quite extraordinary." Clearly humbled, Crosby responded, "Thank you, Mr. President." Later, a reporter noted Crosby seemed very comfortable in that setting and wondered if he'd ever thought of getting into politics. His reply -- "No" -- couldn't come fast or emphatically enough.

            That's because Sidney Crosby, known as Sid the Kid, truly is all hockey and is considered by most the greatest player of his era. Crosby, who scored his 1,000th NHL point on Feb. 16, 2017, has had challengers for that mythical title, and they're mighty formidable: Alex Ovechkin, Carey Price, Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane among them. How does Crosby stay atop the pile? Let us count the ways: 
            
            "Crosby has never stickhandled with the brio of Kane or scored as naturally as Ovechkin," Sports Illustrated's Michael Farber wrote in 2016. "His has been a subtler brand of exceptionalism, born of outsized effort and impressive skating edge work and an unparalleled backhand and all the details that piled high, create a mountain of hockey excellence."</p>

        <p>Avalanche center and Hockey Hall of Fame member. "His ability to dominate below the hash marks, where there is a lot of traffic, is amazingly strong. He's fearless down there. His peripheral vision is as good as anyone who has ever been in the League, and that includes Wayne Gretzky. His faceoff prowess is like Ronnie Francis."

            "What Sid has is a little bit of an extra gear as far as his passing ability, his playmaking ability, the ability to make players around him on his team that much better," Gretzky told Sportsnet's Johnson during the 2016 Cup Final. "Guys like Bobby Orr did it, and Mario [Lemieux] did it, and obviously Crosby's doing it. He's just making his team better."</p>

            <p>But his desire to be the best was a means to an end. Crosby has always been far more about winning than individual recognition. Despite his first lengthy injury absence, he led the Penguins to the 2008 Cup Final in his first season since being named captain (at 20, the youngest in NHL history). Pittsburgh lost to the Detroit Red Wings in six games, and he tied Detroit's Henrik Zetterberg for the scoring lead in the Stanley Cup Playoffs with 27 points.

                The next season, the Penguins won the Cup Final rematch over Detroit in seven games and their first trip to the White House. His 15 goals led all playoff scorers, and his 31 points were second.</p>

                <p>He'd have strong seasons afterward, scoring a League-best 51 goals in 2009-10 (during which he scored the gold-medal winning goal in overtime for Canada at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics), but he'd also suffer from serious post-concussion issues; he was limited 99 regular-season games over three regular seasons from 2010-13. That he didn't modify his hard-charging style when he fully recovered -- he won the 2013-14 scoring title with 104 points and was awarded his second Hart Trophy -- was a testament to his rugged dedication.

                    Like seemingly every player at some point in his career, he'd endure a slump. At 28, Crosby called the prolonged drought to start 2015-16 "the lowest point of my career outside of injury," saying, "I can't say there weren't some doubts starting to creep in."
                    
                    As the Penguins faltered, others had doubts, too. "Crosby just hasn't been himself this season, scoring just six goals in 29 games and sitting with a plus/minus of minus-seven," Neil Greenberg wrote in The Washington Post. "If Crosby isn't the NHL's best player, who is?" 
                    
                    "Of course he was going to come out of it," Kunitz told Farber. "Too much skill. Too great a work ethic."
                    
                    He did, sparking a momentous Penguins turnaround. When it was over, Crosby again hoisted the Cup and, this time, the Conn Smythe Trophy, and headed back to the White House for another meeting with the president.</p>
