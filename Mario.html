    <h2>Hockey</h2>
    <p>Parents sent their son to the hockey section early, at the age of 7 he played for the Hurricanes de Ville-Aymar team. Then the guy won the title of champion of Montreal, because he calmly scored 5-6 goals per match. At the age of 14, the athlete began to prophesy a great future in the NHL.

      The professional career of the Canadian began in the team of the Major Junior Hockey League of Quebec 
      "Voisin de Leval". Three seasons there went for him with a stunning performance of 247 goals and 315 assists.
       And in 1984, he moved to the Pittsburgh Penguins, taking the position of a center forward. It is worth noting that the club at that time was on the verge of bankruptcy, and thanks to such a strong player, the situation changed dramatically. The powerful hockey player was physically hardy, 
      his height was 194 cm, and his weight was 107 kg.</p>

      <p>The following year, Lemieux extended his contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins, according to which his salary also grows. So, in the 1985/1986 season, he becomes the highest paid player in the league after Wayne Gretzky . And soon Mario even got on the same level with him, having received the first Art Ross Trophy in his career, which had previously been given to his colleague on ice for 7 years in a row.

        In 1989, the Canadian began to have health problems, he began to feel back pain, in which he could not dress and undress on his own. At the same time, the athlete did not refuse to perform and showed all the same good results in the games.
        
        Six months later, the pain reached such strength that it did not allow me to go out on the ice anymore. Doctors diagnosed displacement of the discs in the spine, the deteriorating state of health after the operation for a couple of months chained Mario to bed. This was followed by a six-month rehabilitation, after which Lemieux returned to duty. During this time, the club's owners have acquired new, stronger players, including Jaromir Jagr , Mark Recchi, Paul Coffey and others.
        
        Then a new shock awaited Mario in the form of a diagnosis - Hodgkin's disease, which required radiation therapy. Despite the recommendations of the doctors about rest, already 3 months after the start of treatment, after completing the last course, he went from the hospital to the game.
        
        At the end of the 1992/1993 season, Lemieux began to have health problems again, because of which the man took a break and underwent rehabilitation the following year. He returned only at the end of 1995 and, after spending 2 years in active games, left again. His second return took place in 2000, and after 6 years the legendary hockey player announced his retirement.</p>
